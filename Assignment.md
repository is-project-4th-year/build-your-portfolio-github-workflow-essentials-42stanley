## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

- **Branching**: Helped me separate work for different features (e.g., navbar, header updates), making it easier to manage changes without conflicts.
- **Commit Messages**: Using structured commit messages like `feat(header): add main title` improved tracking changes and communicating intent.
- **Pull Requests**: Made it easier to review, merge and track progress for each task, even simulating a merge conflict as practice.
- **Project Boards**: Gave me a clear visual of whatâ€™s done, in progress, or yet to start. It made managing tasks feel like a real software project.
